## Backlog Ordering

We have ordered the backlog items so that the first ones are infrastructure tasks that will need to be in place before development can begin (setting up boilerplate code, a server, etc.).

Next, we've scheduled the items that will give us a very minimal first iteration of the app. Then, we've ordered the various features we'd like to add, in rough order of importance/value.

## Team Definition of Ready

*Before work can be started on a ticket, it must:*
### 1. Have a title
### 2. Have a user story opening sentence
### 3. Have all business requirements clearly defined
### 4. Have clearly defined acceptance criteria
### 5. Have a story point estimate

## Product Backlog
### Jira Product Backlog: <br/>
#### <li> We stored our product backlog in Jira. The Professor and TA have been given access.</li>
#### <li> [JIRA-URL](https://vuca-nators.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/FT/boards/1/backlog) </li>

### Estimating the Backlog: <br/>
#### <li> The developers all contributed to a one at a time estimating activity points using Polly. A multi-question app in Slack that uses comments and questions to engage in discussions over each user story. We used the Fibonacci Scale for estimating our user story points. The Fibonacci sequence is exponential instead of linear so it helped us to identify the different complexities of each story. </li>
